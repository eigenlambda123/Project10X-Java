# **Project10X: Java**

*A backend-focused 10-project series to master Java OOP fundamentals through real-world systems — part of the Project10X learning method.*

> **Academic Context**: This project series is part of the formal curriculum for **CSOP101 – Object-Oriented Programming**.


---

## **Overview**

This repository documents a progressive series of Java projects aimed at building deep, transferable backend skills through real-world systems.

Each project tackles a different OOP principle or design pattern and includes:

* Core object modeling and encapsulation
* Clean use of interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism
* Modular class structure and separation of concerns
* Stretch goals for file I/O, collections, exceptions, CLI tools, and simple services

Projects are designed to simulate real backend logic — not just academic exercises — with clear progression and reusable design patterns.

## **Skills and Technologies**

* Java 17+
* Core OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
* Interfaces and Abstract Classes
* Java Collections: List, Set, Map
* File I/O (BufferedReader, FileWriter)
* Basic Exception Handling and Logging
* Object Serialization and Deserialization
* CLI Design using Scanner and Text Menus
* Modular Design and Separation of Concerns
* Simple MVC Architecture Patterns

---

## **Purpose**

**Project10X-Java** is a deep learning journey built to:

* Master object-oriented principles through practice and real examples
* Build backend-focused thinking using clean code and separation of concerns
* Develop transferable Java skills ready for Spring, Android, or backend APIs
* Learn to design full app logic without relying on frameworks or boilerplate

---

## **Usage**

Each project includes:

* Setup instructions and how to run via terminal or IDE
* Explanation of OOP features used (with inline comments)
* Optional stretch goals for enhancements
* Suggestions for refactoring and extra features
* Minimal dependencies — built using plain Java SE

This repo is ideal for Java learners, backend-focused developers, or those preparing for technical interviews by mastering fundamentals.
